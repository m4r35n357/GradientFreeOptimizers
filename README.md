# Various Gradient-free optimizers

## Pure c99 (plus optional 3D OpenGL visualization)

The programs can be built either with Clang or GCC.
All console programs are written to and depend _only_ on the c99 standard and library (strictly speaking, the WG14/N1256 _draft_ standard!).
External dependencies (OpenGL, FreeGLUT & GLEW) are only needed for the OpenGL plotters (*-gl).

All simulation floating point operations are executed in _long double_ precision.
This gives a choice of precision and performance on different platforms.

Platform | Long Double Implementation
----------|-----------
x86 / x86-64 | 80 bit hardware float
armhf | 64 bit hardware float
aarch64 | 128 bit _software_ float

These are converted to _float_ for use by OpenGL.

All scripts are in _Posix_ shell syntax.

## Quick Start

### Requirements - Debian/Ubuntu packages
```
sudo apt install bc git build-essential freeglut3-dev glew-utils libglew-dev
```

### Download
```
git clone https://github.com/m4r35n357/GradientFreeOptimizers/single-simplex-ic
cd single-simplex-ic
```

### c Build (Clang by default)

```
make depclean
```
once only, unless you have edited any header files, then either of
```
make
make nogl
```
There should be NO errors or warnings.
The default build requires OpenGL development libraries, and produces the *-gl executables.
The nogl build is pure c99 and produces the *-std executables.
See the Makefile for various additional "test" targets.
Optionally
```
make ctags
```
can make things more comfortable in some editors and IDEs.
There is a pre-commit script for use with git, which rebuilds everything and runs some tests.
To use it:
```
cp pre-commit .git/hooks
```

# Usage

## Nelder-Mead

Nelder, John A.; R. Mead (1965). "A simplex method for function minimization". Computer Journal. 7 (4): 308â€“313. doi:10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308.

This code was originally based on a [project](https://github.com/matteotiziano/nelder-mead) by Matteo Maggioni in 2023.

This implementation is a little different from those in most popular/common solvers in that it uses a pair of _regular_ (dual) simplexes, and the user must specify an initial "scale".
The vertex coordinates are generated using an algorithm which is described (open access) [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11590-022-01953-y).
The adaptive algorithm is described (open access) [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225691623_Implementing_the_Nelder-Mead_simplex_algorithm_with_adaptive_parameters).

Parameter | Meaning
----------|-----------
1 | Display precision (3..36)
2 | Floating point format (0 for fixed, 1 for exponential)
3 | Number of dimensions
4 | Maximum error for convergence
5 | Maximum number of iterations
6 | Initial simplex scale
7 | Adaptive (0 for no, 1 for yes)
8 | Initialization (0 for explicit coordinates, 1 or more for number of random "runs")

If Initialization = 0
Parameter | Meaning
----------|-----------
9+ | Coordinate list

If Initialization = 1
Parameter | Meaning
----------|-----------
9 | Lower limit
10 | Upper limit

Examples
```
./nm-ackley-std 3 0 3 1.0e-6 10000 1.0 0 1 -10 10
./nm-ackley-gl 3 0 3 1.0e-6 10000 1.0 0 1 -10 10
```

## Multi-directional Search

See https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5827867 (incidentally, osti.gov have got their pronouns in a twist in a rather surprising way, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Torczon)

Parameter | Meaning
----------|-----------
1 | Display precision (3..36)
2 | Floating point format (0 for fixed, 1 for exponential)
3 | Number of dimensions
4 | Maximum error for convergence
5 | Maximum number of iterations
6 | Initial simplex scale
7 | Initialization (0 for explicit coordinates, 1 for random in range)

If Initialization = 0
Parameter | Meaning
----------|-----------
8+ | Coordinate list

If Initialization = 1
Parameter | Meaning
----------|-----------
8 | Lower limit
9 | Upper limit

Examples
```
./mds-ackley-std 3 0 3 1.0e-6 10000 1.0 0 1 -10 10
./mds-ackley-gl 3 0 3 1.0e-6 10000 1.0 0 1 -10 10

## Whale Optimization

Mirjalili, Seyedali, and Andrew Lewis. "The whale optimization algorithm." Advances in Engineering Software 95 (2016): 51-67.

There is a Matlab implementation available from [here](https://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/55667-the-whale-optimization-algorithm)

This is a _tweaked_ version of the algorithm as published:
* "Prey" is explicitly excluded from the update code
* Updated "prey" is calculated and used immediately rather than waiting for each iteration to complete
* Out-of-range agents are randomly "teleported" instead of "clipping" them at the limit
* I have attempted to set the algorithm variable "b" to something useful

Parameter | Meaning
----------|-----------
1 | Display precision (3..36)
2 | Floating point format (0 for fixed, 1 for exponential)
3 | Number of dimensions
4 | Number of search agents
5 | Number of iterations
6 | Lower limit
7 | Upper limit

Examples
```
./whale-ackley-std 3 0 3 50 100 -5 5
./whale-ackley-gl 3 0 3 50 100 -5 5
```

## Spiral Optimization

Based on the algorithm described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_optimization_algorithm).

There is experimental code for repeatedly restarting the algorithm until the result stops changing.
Un-comment the commented line in spiral.c and rebuild to try it.

Parameter | Meaning
----------|-----------
1 | Display precision (3..36)
2 | Floating point format (0 for fixed, 1 for exponential)
3 | Number of dimensions
4 | Number of search agents
5 | Number of iterations
6 | Spiral "rule" (0 for "periodic descent", 1 for "convergence")
7 | Lower limit
8 | Upper limit

Examples
```
./spiral-ackley-std 3 0 3 50 100 0 -5 5
./spiral-ackley-gl 3 0 3 50 100 0 -5 5
```

## "stats" script

Runs either spiral or whale algorithms multiple times agains a target value.
For each run, the output is green if the result is below the threshold, and red otherwise.

Parameter | Meaning
----------|-----------
1 | Number of runs
2 | Threshold
3+ | whale or spiral "std" command

Examples
```
./stats 100 0.001 ./whale-dixon-price-std 3 0 6 100 100 -5 5
./stats 100 -117 ./spiral-st-std 3 0 3 30 100 1 -5 5
```

## "Global" Optimization

Whale and spiral are widely recognized as "global" optimizers.
A common feature of these "meta-heuristic" methods is an _exploration_ phase followed by a _refinement_ phase (in practice the transition is a gradual process).
Refinement is not the same as convergence, you get what you are given after a specified number of iterations!
Perhaps "settling" is a better description.
The refinement makes it harder to jump out of a stubborn local minimum.

I have adapted the Nelder-Mead method to do a series of random runs, while keeping the best result. and accounting for total number of iterations and function evaluations.
The randomness is not reduced by refinement so global minima are always accessible, even if not actually reached within the set limits.

The [Dixon-Price function](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/dixonpr.html) is a very good example of a function with a stubborn local minimum (and _all_ minima at non-zero coordinates) that gets harder to escape as dimension increases.
To see the problem, try these commands, and then experiment with changing the number of agents, iterations etc.:
```
./stats 100 0.001 ./whale-dixon-price-std 3 0 8 1000 1000 -10 10
./stats 100 0.001 ./spiral-dixon-price-std 3 0 8 1000 1000 0 -10 10
./stats 100 0.001 ./spiral-dixon-price-std 3 0 8 1000 1000 1 -10 10
./nm-dixon-price-std 3 0 8 1.0e-6 100000 20.0 1 100 -10 10 >/dev/null
```
The [Styblinski-Tang function](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/stybtang.html) is also troublesome, but less "pathlogical".
```
./stats 100 -313.0 ./whale-st-std 3 0 8 100 200 -5 5
./stats 100 -313.0 ./spiral-st-std 3 0 8 100 1000 0 -5 5
./stats 100 -313.0 ./spiral-st-std 3 0 8 100 1000 1 -5 5
./nm-st-std 3 0 8 1.0e-6 100000 10.0 1 100 -5 5 >/dev/null
```
Here are some 16-D starting points:
```
./stats 100 0.001 ./whale-dixon-price-std 3 0 16 1000 1000 -10 10
./nm-dixon-price-std 3 0 16 1.0e-6 100000 20.0 1 1000 -10 10 >/dev/null
```
```
./stats 100 -626.0 ./whale-st-std 3 0 16 200 200 -5 5
./nm-st-std 3 0 16 1.0e-6 100000 10.0 1 1000 -5 5 >/dev/null
```
Of course this is comparing apples to oranges, with just two functions, and the results are not always clear-cut (and vary with each run), but total iterations and function evaluations are shown explicitly in each case.
Do your own experiments!
